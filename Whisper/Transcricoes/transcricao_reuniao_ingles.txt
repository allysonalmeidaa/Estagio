[0:00:04 -> 0:00:06] SPEAKER_00: and that's it, the recording was started. So, Álvaro, thank you very much for your help, man.

[0:00:13 -> 0:00:16] SPEAKER_00: I needed to do this little meeting there, like, I don't know, a few minutes,

[0:00:16 -> 0:00:27] SPEAKER_00: I needed to do this little meeting there, like, I don't know, a few minutes,  at least, to do the IA test that I'm using through Python, which Menom sent me an IA that you can

[0:00:27 -> 0:00:29] SPEAKER_00: at least, to do the IA test that I'm using through Python, which Menom sent me an IA that you can

[0:00:33 -> 0:00:36] SPEAKER_00: at least, to do the IA test that I'm using through Python, which Menom sent me an IA that you can  use through Python, you know? Then you, like, it will work, it doesn't matter if it's like a library,

[0:00:37 -> 0:00:38] SPEAKER_00: use through Python, you know? Then you, like, it will work, it doesn't matter if it's like a library,

[0:00:39 -> 0:00:43] SPEAKER_00: use through Python, you know? Then you, like, it will work, it doesn't matter if it's like a library,  you install it, it's actually a library, from Python too, and then it works like that, you can

[0:00:43 -> 0:00:47] SPEAKER_00: you install it, it's actually a library, from Python too, and then it works like that, you can

[0:00:47 -> 0:00:49] SPEAKER_00: you install it, it's actually a library, from Python too, and then it works like that, you can

[0:00:49 -> 0:01:00] SPEAKER_00: you install it, it's actually a library, from Python too, and then it works like that, you can  put audio there, an mp3 file, for example, you can put a video file, for example,  this one is the screen recording, it will generate a video file, right? Then an mp4, for example,

[0:01:00 -> 0:01:02] SPEAKER_00: this one is the screen recording, it will generate a video file, right? Then an mp4, for example,

[0:01:02 -> 0:01:10] SPEAKER_00: this one is the screen recording, it will generate a video file, right? Then an mp4, for example,  then there are those files, another audio file that I recorded through the computer microphone, which is  m4a, and there are other formats, then it can, like, you put your audio there and it transcribes

[0:01:12 -> 0:01:13] SPEAKER_00: m4a, and there are other formats, then it can, like, you put your audio there and it transcribes

[0:01:13 -> 0:01:19] SPEAKER_00: m4a, and there are other formats, then it can, like, you put your audio there and it transcribes  what's in the audio, besides transcribing what's in the audio, it can also, like, depending on the side

[0:01:20 -> 0:01:33] SPEAKER_00: what's in the audio, besides transcribing what's in the audio, it can also, like, depending on the side  you put in the code, it can detect which language is being spoken in that audio, and then

[0:01:34 -> 0:01:38] SPEAKER_00: you put in the code, it can detect which language is being spoken in that audio, and then  another thing is that it can, for example, we're here speaking in Portuguese, I can transcribe there

[0:01:39 -> 0:01:48] SPEAKER_00: another thing is that it can, for example, we're here speaking in Portuguese, I can transcribe there  and I can also ask it to translate to English, for example, it's another thing that it can also do,

[0:01:48 -> 0:01:52] SPEAKER_00: and I can also ask it to translate to English, for example, it's another thing that it can also do,

[0:01:53 -> 0:01:57] SPEAKER_00: so it's just to test, because I've tested with mp3 audio so far, and I haven't tested with video.

[0:01:58 -> 0:01:59] SPEAKER_00: so it's just to test, because I've tested with mp3 audio so far, and I haven't tested with video.

[0:02:02 -> 0:02:04] SPEAKER_01: And then I'll show you, you say that, man.

[0:02:10 -> 0:02:13] SPEAKER_01: I'll show you that it's working.

[0:02:13 -> 0:02:13] SPEAKER_01: I'll show you that it's working.

[0:02:20 -> 0:02:22] SPEAKER_01: Write that you have a world record, then.

[0:02:25 -> 0:02:26] SPEAKER_01: Write that you have a world record, then.  But I think it's already working, man.

[0:02:27 -> 0:02:29] SPEAKER_01: But I think it's already working, man.

[0:02:30 -> 0:02:34] SPEAKER_01: But I think it's already working, man.  Anything you cut, I'll do it.

[0:02:34 -> 0:02:37] SPEAKER_00: Anything you cut, I'll do it.

[0:02:41 -> 0:02:43] SPEAKER_01: It was just to test it later.

[0:02:44 -> 0:02:45] SPEAKER_01: It was just to test it later.  So, what's up? Studying?

[0:02:47 -> 0:02:48] SPEAKER_01: So, what's up? Studying?

[0:02:49 -> 0:02:50] SPEAKER_01: No, I'm going to sleep, Luca.

[0:02:51 -> 0:02:54] SPEAKER_01: No, I'm going to sleep, Luca.  Ah, so it's nice. I think I'm going to rest today, tomorrow I study.

[0:02:56 -> 0:02:56] SPEAKER_01: Ah, so it's nice. I think I'm going to rest today, tomorrow I study.
